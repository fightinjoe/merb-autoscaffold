merb_autoscaffold
=================

Merb AutoScaffold is a Merb plugin that provides scaffolding for free
for all models.

==== Usage:

You must first build and install the gem.  From the merb_autoscaffold directory, run:

$ sudo rake gem install

Then add a dependency in your init.rb file:

dependency 'merb_autoscaffold'

Scaffolds will then be available for all models in your application.  If a controller
for a model already exists, then any actions in that controller will be preserved,
while the missing CRUD actions will be added

==== Example:

# /app/models/blog.rb

class Blog < DataMapper::Base
  property :title,   :string
  property :content, :text

  has_many :comments
end

# /config/init.rb

...
dependency 'merb_autoscaffold'
...

# Run the Merb server

$ merb

# Scaffolds are now available at http://localhost:4000/scaffolds from your web browser

# You can customize the path to the scaffolds by editing the AutoScaffold's configs
# in the /config/init.rb file in the +after_app_loads+ block:

Merb::BootLoader.after_app_loads do
  # scaffolds will be available at /foo instead of /scaffolds
  Merb::Plugins.config[:merb_autoscaffold][:namespace] = 'foo'
end

==== Caveats

Currently, autoscaffolds only work with DataMapper models.
